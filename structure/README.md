# Structure

This directory illustrates a plausible express.js application structure: 

  * handling multiple configuration
  * using different environment variables to customize behaviour
  * having both API and server-side rendered pages
  * serving documentation for the APIs

Begin your read from [`index.js`](structure/index.js) and go backwards for the full ride.
